## Building from source

It is assumed that you have already installed BaseX and Maven.

Download or clone or fork the git repository, which has all the source files.
In the directory where you have just downloaded the project, do `maven install`. 
This will create a .jar file in the `target` directory.

## Installing

Copy the .jar file from the `target` directory into the `lib/custom` directory of your BaseX installation.
Start, or restart BaseX.
